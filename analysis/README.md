# Analysis

Semi-automated scripts for processing this data set

### Data processing scripts

The folder `scripts` contains simple bash scripts for upstream processing using
a combination of [Qiime 1.9.1](https://github.com/biocore/qiime) and
[VSEARCH](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch). These scripts were used to
cluster and annotate OTUs and build a [.biom table](https://github.com/pnnl/bernstein-2016-productivity-and-diversity/tree/master/data/otus_vsearch).

### Ad-hoc analysis

The folder `otus_vsearch_processed` contains miscellaneous scripts, reference
data sets, and results used to explore the feature abundance table.

### Graphing and analysis in R

The folder `phyloseq` contains R scripts and their output graphs, made largely
with the [Phyloseq](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq)
[package](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/).
